# Sticky Buy box on scroll effect
The Buy Box Scroll is a feature on the Product Detail Page (PDP) where the buy or add to cart button remains visible as the user scrolls down, ensuring it's always accessible even when the left-side image gallery is larger than the right-side buy or add to cart button grid. This feature significantly enhances user experience (UX).

And on scroll top buy or add to cart <strong>grid top</strong> remains visible as the user scrolls up until user reach the left grid top.
